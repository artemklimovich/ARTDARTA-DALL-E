# What is this?
This is a notepad that uses a decoder to work with the DALL-E neural network and CLIP to create images from text. The best images created are used to create NFT tokens in the [Artificial Intelligence Machine Art](https://opensea.io/collection/aiartmachine) collection in OpenSea. As the project evolves, we will make it simpler, better, and more user-friendly.

This is the official PyTorch package for the discrete VAE used for DALLÂ·E. The transformer used to generate the images from the text is not part of this code release.

# Original Installation

Before running [the example notebook](notebooks/usage.ipynb), you will need to install the package using

	pip install DALL-E
